Overview:

This repository contains Python code implementing the Random Forest algorithm from scratch, along with examples demonstrating its usage for classification and regression tasks. Random Forest is a powerful ensemble learning technique widely used for both classification and regression problems. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode (for classification) or mean prediction (for regression) of the individual trees.

Contents:

random_forest.py: This file contains the implementation of the Random Forest algorithm using object-oriented programming in Python. It includes classes and methods for constructing the ensemble, training the model, making predictions, and evaluating performance.

classification_example.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook provides an example of how to use the Random Forest implementation for a classification task. It includes sample data, model training, prediction, and evaluation steps.

regression_example.ipynb: Similarly, this Jupyter notebook demonstrates the usage of the Random Forest implementation for a regression task. It also includes sample data, model training, prediction, and evaluation steps tailored for regression.

data/: This directory contains sample datasets used in the provided examples. These datasets cover both classification and regression scenarios to showcase the versatility of the Random Forest algorithm.

Dependencies:

Python 3.x
